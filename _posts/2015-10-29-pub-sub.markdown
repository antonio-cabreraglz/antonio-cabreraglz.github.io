# Publish-Subscribe
The publish-subscribe pattern (or PubSub) is described as a way to broadcast messages to different Observers, decoupling them from them from the subjects (the subjects being the producers of the messages), the subject must be able to notify all the interested observers (even none). The pattern expands upon the Observer by adding the notion of an event channel for communicating event notifications. (Hohpe & Woolf, 2012, p. 106)

Each subscriber must be notified of a particular event once but should not be notified more than once for the same event, once they have been notified the message should be considered consumed. To avoid violating the Observer pattern, the subscribers should not coordinate to determine if the messages are consumed. When using concurrent consumers they should not compete but share the message.

PubSub works like this: the producer has one input channel that splits into multiple channels one for each of the consumers, when an event is published, the producer sends a copy of the message to each of the consumers, so the message is consumed only once on each one of them.

This pattern can be used as a debugging tool, eavesdropping in the message channel without disrupting the message flow. This can help to avoid to use `println` messages or logging them, but this can also be a disadvantage, someone can write a program to listen to the messages.

# Implementation

## The problem
1. Generate an event
2. Send the message to multiple consumers


### Go implementation

The `PubSub` type has a channel which receives all the commands that are performed on this pattern, like subscribing, sending a message, etc.; Go channels should not be shared between multiple goroutines because it can lead to deadlocks and race conditions. To avoid this the `PubSub` goroutine is hidden from outside the package, instead a number of methods are provided which are the ones who write to it.

{% highlight go %}
type PubSub struct {
	commandChan chan command
	capacity    int
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next, a capacity for each of the subscriber goroutines it’s declared; this will accomplish two things, the buffer will not send messages if the goroutine has not finished processing the last message and better control will be had when the channel will be closed avoiding to close it when it has remaining elements. After creating an instance of `PubSub`, the constructor starts a goroutine with the `start` function, where is all the functionality happens.

{% highlight go %}
func New(capacity int) *PubSub {
	ps := &PubSub{make(chan command), capacity}
	go ps.start()
	return ps
}
{% endhighlight %}

The channel manager has all the goroutines and the topics, to ease the channel management, each of the topics is stored in a map, with the key being the topic, the other one is a reverse of the first one, which is used to unsubscribe the goroutine from all topics, leaving it open to subscribe to another topic or closed.

{% highlight go %}
type channelManager struct {
	topics    map[string]map[chan interface{}]bool
	revTopics map[chan interface{}]map[string]bool
}
{% endhighlight %}

The main loop, which reads from the command channel, consists of two parts, the first one has two commands which do not require a topic, like unsubscribing of one channel or shutting down the server. The other part manages the operations which require a specific topic or topics. each of the operations is done by the channel manager, while the main loop just calls the methods depending of the command sent.

{% highlight go %}
loop:
	for command := range ps.commandChan {
		if command.topics == nil {
			switch command.op {
			case unsubAll:
				chanm.removeChannel(command.ch)

			case shutdown:
				break loop
			}

			continue loop
		}

		for _, topic := range command.topics {
			switch command.op {
			case sub:
				chanm.add(topic, command.ch, false)

			case subOnce:
				chanm.add(topic, command.ch, true)

			case pub:
				chanm.send(topic, command.msg)
{% endhighlight %}

As mentioned earlier, the exported functions can perform operations, to simplify this some methods call private functions to avoid cluttering.

{% highlight go %}
func (ps *PubSub) Sub(topics ...string) chan interface{} {
	return ps.sub(sub, topics...)
}
{% endhighlight %}

To use the package simple use the New method and specify a capacity for the channels:

{% highlight go %}
ps := pubsub.New(10)
{% endhighlight %}

Then call the `Sub` method with a topic, this will return a channel using the channel generator pattern (Pike, n.d.):

{% highlight go %}
func (ps *PubSub) Sub(topics ...string) chan interface{} {
	return ps.sub(sub, topics...)
}

func (ps *PubSub) sub(op operation, topics ...string) chan interface{} {
	ch := make(chan interface{}, ps.capacity)
	ps.commandChan <- command{op: op, topics: topics, ch: ch}
	return ch
}
{% endhighlight %}

Each of the returned channels has a `interface{}` datatype to delegate the data validation to the main program and avoid coupling.

{% highlight go %}
topicA := ps.Sub("TopicA")
topicA2 := ps.Sub("TopicA")
topicB := ps.Sub("TopicB")
{% endhighlight %}

After this, messages can be send to topics using the `Pub` method:

{% highlight go %}
ps.Pub("Hello", "TopicB")
ps.Pub("Bye", "TopicA")
{% endhighlight %}

### Elixir implementation

This implementation uses `Genserver`, which is a behavior module for elixir which implements the server side of a server-client relation. `GenServer` is used to keep state (Elixir is stateless due to being a functional language) this avoids the use of a loop and a recursive function that retains the state. This also implements a set of generic interface functions for functionality. (“GenServer – Elixir v1.1.1,” n.d.)

The first function of the server must be `start_link()` which calls the `init` method of our function:

{% highlight elixir %}
  def start_link() do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, [{:name, __MODULE__}])
  end
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, only a dictionary is needed (which will be used to store the name and the `PID` of the clients), which is returned at the end of the `init` function.

{% highlight elixir %}
  def init(_args) do
    Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)
    {:ok, %{}}
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Next, if the client needs a synchronous call the `GenServer.cast` callback will be used, otherwise `Genserver.call` will be used instead. For example the subscribe function only receives the PID and the topic of the subscriber. To finish the call a `handle_cast` method must be provided, which also will inject the state of the GenServer.

{% highlight elixir %}
@spec subscribe(pid, topic) :: :ok
  def subscribe(pid, topic) do
    GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, {:subscribe, %{topic: topic, pid: pid}})
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Using the pattern matching capabilities, the `handle_cast` function can handle multiple types of request:

{% highlight elixir %}
  def handle_cast({:subscribe, %{topic: topic, pid: pid}}, state) do
    Process.link(pid)
    new_state = Map.put(state, topic, [pid | get_subscribers(topic, state)])
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end

  def handle_cast({:unsubscribe, %{topic: topic, pid: pid}}, state) do
    Process.unlink(pid)
    new_list = get_subscribers(topic, state) |> List.delete(pid)
    new_state = Map.put(state, topic, new_list)
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
{% endhighlight %}

To start to send and receive messages, first we need to start the server using `PubSub.start_link()`, after this register all the clients and topics needed.

### Scala Implementation

The implementation in scala is fairly simple, `PubSubServer` extends the `EventBus` trait. It has an `eventStream` property on the local `ActorSystem` and its used to easily register subscribers and allow to publish events.

Two classes are used to support the PubSub, `Channel` and `Message`, the former has then name of the distribution channel, and the latter has the channel and the message to be delivered to the subscribers.

{% highlight scala %}
case class Channel(name: String)
case class Message(channel: Channel, payload: Any)
{% endhighlight %}

To create an `EventBus` the declaration of a the `Classifier`, `Event` and `Subscriber` types is requiered, for this `SubchannelClassification` they are set to `Channel`, `Message` and `ActorRef` respectively.

{% highlight scala %}
class PubSubServer extends EventBus with SubchannelClassification {
  type Classifier = Channel
  type Event = Message
  type Subscriber = ActorRef
{% endhighlight %}

The `classify` function returns the classifier of the event, which is the channel attribute of the `Message` class. This will be used to match a specific `Channel` or subclassification to the `Channel` a subscriber has specified.

{% highlight scala %}
protected def classify(event: Event): Classifier = {
	event.channel
}
{% endhighlight %}

The instance of `Subclassification[Classifier]` is used to classify the channels and provides two functions, `subclassification` and `isSubclass`. The former determines an exact match while the latter is used to match subclassifications, the first argument is the `Channel` the subscriber is subscribed and the second is the `Channel` the `Message` is being published.

{% highlight scala %}
protected def subclassification = new Subclassification[Classifier] {
	def isEqual(
			subscribedToClassifier: Classifier,
			eventClassifier: Classifier): Boolean = {

		subscribedToClassifier.equals(eventClassifier)
	}

	def isSubclass(
			subscribedToClassifier: Classifier,
			eventClassifier: Classifier): Boolean = {

		subscribedToClassifier.name.startsWith(eventClassifier.name)
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

To use the `PubSubServer` first, some subscribers are required, which all of them all actors:

{% highlight scala %}
class SubscriberA extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case msg: Message =>
      println(msg.payload + " received from sub a")
      Client.completedStep
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

An instance of `PubSubServer` is created and now all the subscribers can subscribe to a topic of preference:  

{% highlight scala %}
pubsubserver.subscribe(subsA, Channel("topicA"))
pubsubserver.subscribe(subsB, Channel("topicB"))
pubsubserver.subscribe(subsC, Channel("topicA"))
{% endhighlight %}


Finally, to publish a message the case class `Message` is used:

{% highlight scala %}
pubsubserver.publish(Message(Channel("topicA"), "Hello"))
{% endhighlight %}

## Qualitative observations

Handling channels is quite a nuisance in go,  since they are their own datatype and they is basically stateless, all the management must be done by big routines that check for every state that a custom type must carry with, on the other hand, elixir processes (at least with GenServer or custom loops) can carry a state on the same message received and respond to it accordingly, making easier the development of patterns like this. But, since messaging in Elixir must be done via pattern matching, it can lead to write to more functions, may be small but it can lead to be more complex than in go. Besides, custom types in go can also include functions or more custom types that an specific app can need.
